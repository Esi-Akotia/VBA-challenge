# VBA-challenge

Here is my submission for the VBA Challenge on Stock Data which includes the following: 

1. The Excel file used to run the code.
2. A file with the VBA script with all the lines of code I used to complete the assingment.


Please note:
I got assistance from the live chat on SLack (AskBCS) and they gave me guidance on lines 102 to 104 where I had to find the maximum and minimum values in the column to produce the alues for Greatest % increase and Greatest % decrease.

Thank you!
